**Design Overview:**
Designed a modern, responsive website layout tailored for a data/tech-focused brand.
Applied consistent typography, spacing, and color schemes for cohesive branding.
Structured sections include landing page, feature highlights, and service breakdowns.

**Design Process & Notes**
Custom Icons: Created few icons manually using Figma’s shape tools, due to lack of ready-made assets.
Layout Precision: Used rulers and alignment guides to ensure visual consistency and balanced spacing.
Visual Effects: Designed hover-ready card states using drop shadows and borders to guide future interactions.
Logo Challenge: Recreated the Cascal logo with custom curves and path adjustments, as it couldn't be derived from simple shapes.
